if we do it right this could actually be super simple
every time you make a new window or session you just make a folder with it's name
every time you make a new pane it creates a file named the pane index
when you swap a tab you're just reading in the first line of a file and then appending the pane id to the file
so it's basically a FIFO queue, super simple
adding new tabs is really simple, we just append and don't pull one out of the queue
since we're managing our own queues we can have 1 tab in many panes
when we duplicate a tab we need to create a file with the definitions for that tab
	these are kept in their own directory instead of being part of the hierarchy
when a shared tab is moved out of the active pane it's appended to all the files it's part of
when it's moved into an active pane we read the tabdef file to find all the other tabs it's part of and remove that tab from those queues
	since we have tabdef files we can go as simple or fancy as we want
	this system can scale
	if i was dumb i'd consider putting tab defs in the hierarchy and symlinking them
	but that would be lots of work for no reward
at the very least it would definitely make sense to track the position in the queue of those tabs instead of just pure FIFO
that way it would just feel natural and it'd be worth it
like you could keep track of tab order

i do also think it would be cool if sending panes was just done by basically swapping tabs
like it could just dynamically always make it so that when you swap off a pane it could cut to the start of the other queues, maybe with like a timeout + swapping other panes cancels it
so you just wanna move pane? swap out here, swap it in there
that would feel nice

prolly best to make it separate buttons tho so you can still have order if you want
so you have 2 extra binds. One grabs the active pane, and it'll swap in the next pane from that tab group in. but it won't put that pane back in the buffer. instead, it's put in a temporary buffer, and the next time you press the cycle hotkey it will move the active pane to back of queue, but instead of bringing in from the front of the queue it will put the tab you picked up in the active pane

and duplicate pane works the same but it just doesn't change anything in the source tab group. But it pulls the tab into your pocket group which you can drop in wherever you want
