# tmux-quick-tabs
Allows you to add multiple "tabs" inside a pane that you can quickly switch between. There are many ways to switch between multiple views, and this same functionality can be achieved in different(easier) ways. Right now this is just a small personal project and it's very unpolished. If anyone does use this let me know what you think.
